		<h1>MFA</h1>
		<h2>(Redemption Calls Only)</h2>

		Shareholder calling:
		<ul>
			<li>Entity accounts (i.e Trusts, Corporations, Non-Profits) are excluded</li>
			<li>Primerica Representatives called as the Representative are excluded
			Note: Please remember we cannot take trade instructions from an Office Manager
			and that Primerica Representatives cannot authorize anyone to speak or act
			on their or the shareholder’s behalf.</li>
		</ul>

		Confirm one of the following scenarios is true on the REDEMPTION requests and
		that we have a cell phone number of file, then follow the scripting below

		<ul>
			<li><strong>The redemption amount is greater than $30,000</strong></li>
			<li><strong>An address on the account changed within the past 3 months</strong></li>
			<li><strong>Bank instructions were added/changed on an account within the past 3 months</strong></li>
		</ul>

		<div class="script">
			"I WOULD BE HAPPY TO HELP YOU WITH YOUR REDEMPTION TODAY, BEFORE WE BEGIN, MAY I
			ASK FOR YOUR CELL PHONE NUMBER?"

		</div>

		<br>

		Note – If mobile phone number is not on populated in CRM or the mobile phone is
		not accessible by the shareholder, Call Center defaults to standard authentication according to CCQ Guidebook.

		<br><br>

		<strong>(The Call Center should NEVER provide any phone number to the caller
			prior to it being verified)</strong>

		<br>

		<h3>Option 1: No Cell Phone Number Currently on File</h3>

		<ol>
			<li>If we do not have it on file - We should update the account and then proceed
			with the redemption request <strong>without sending the MFA Code.</strong></li>

			<li>No memorandum will need to be added to the account.</li>

		</ol>

		<h3>Option 2: The Caller Does Not Have a Cell Phone</h3>

		If caller does not have a cell phone number we should then proceed with the
		redemption and must add the following memorandum to the account –

		<br><br>

		<strong>Callers Name(s) – Currently does not have a cell phone</strong>

		<br><br>

		See bottom of procedure on how to add a memorandum


		<h3>Option 3: We Have the Cell Phone Number on File</h3>

		If we currently have the cell phone number on file –

		<br><br>

		<div class="script">
			"TO INCREASE OUR LEVEL OF SRCURITY - I WOULD LIKE TO SEND YOU A ONE-TIME
			AUTHORIZATION CODE. DO YOU HAVE YOUR CELL PHONE WITH YOU AND ARE YOU ABLE TO RECEIVE TEXTS?"

				Continue with the redemption request as we do today
				(see the CCQ Guidebook), please inform the caller that on future withdrawals
				an authorization code may be required before placing a redemption and they
				should have their cell phone available before calling into to the customer service line.

				<br><br>

				<div class="script">

					and continue to process your transaction today.”
					“Please keep in mind that going forward you may be required to provide us with
					an authorization code before we can process your redemption request, so in
					the future when calling in to do a redemption request please have your cell
					phone available in case we need to send an authorization code.”

				</div>

				<br>

				Call Center Agent should add a memorandum to the account -

				<br><br>


				<strong>Shareholder did not have cell phone and was provided with a soft warning.</strong>

				<br><br>

				<br><br>
				"Please let me know once you have authentication code.”
				<br><br>
				“Can you please provide me with the six digit code that you received?”
				”Thank you, I have XXXXXX, is that correct?”
				”Thank you, your authentication code has been confirmed.”
			</div>
			<br>
			The CSR will add a memorandum to the account in CRM, and will copy and
			paste the authentication code from the MFA tool.
			<br><br>
			<strong>Authentication Code XXXXXX has been confirmed</strong>
			<br><br>
			Continue with the redemption request.
			<br><br>
			NOTE – CSR will resend authentication code up to 2 times
			<br><br>
			<div class="script">
				”Unfortunately, I could not confirm your authentication code. I would
				like to send you another authentication code.”
			</div>
			<br>

			If a valid authentication code is not provided after 2 attempts the
			financial transaction will not be processed.
			<br><br>
			The CSR will report this information to their manager by emailing the
			Primerica Box. The Call Center manager will forward the details to the
			Client Service Officer for further review with the management company.
